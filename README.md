# School-Database-final

A C++ CLI application that facilitates the management of a class roster database. Completed in June of 2020. 

## Background

This application replaces an existing roster management system for a small fictional university. It has a simple command-line interface that prints all output and user prompts to the screen.

The school has several business requirements that must be met that including the following:

* An enumerated data type must be created and used to represent course types. The available options are Security, Network, and Software. 
* A student and roster class must both exist.
* The application will parse student data into individual student objects.
* There must be functionality to remove a student, and the user should not be able to access a student record after its deletion.
* There must be a function to print all emails that are not in a valid format. 
* The program must add all students to the student roster. 
* There must be destructors to facilitate appropriate memory management.

## Implementation

Implementing this application was reasonably straightforward since my first two undergrad years focused on C++ exclusively at Portland State University. 

There was some essential memory management to implement. Data structures and some of the more complex concepts in C++ were unnecessary (ex: pointers, pass by reference v value, etc.). 

It was a good refresher project.
